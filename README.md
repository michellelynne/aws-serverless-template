AWS Serverless Template
==============================================

This project is designed to make it easier to create and deploy serverless applications. 
It started out with a CodeStar project, but it can be used on it's on. First is some information 
from AWS, then what I added. This is very much a work in progress and will improve over time.
Feel free to add issues/concerns.

What's Here From CodeStar
-----------

This sample includes:

* README.md - this file
* buildspec.yml - this file is used by AWS CodeBuild to package your
  application for deployment to AWS Lambda
* index.py - this file contains the sample Python code for the web service
* template.yml - this file contains the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) used
  by AWS CloudFormation to deploy your application to AWS Lambda and Amazon API
  Gateway.
* tests/ - this directory contains unit tests for your application
* template-configuration.json - this file contains the project ARN with placeholders used for tagging resources with the project ID

To run your tests locally, go to the root directory of the
sample code and run the `python -m unittest discover tests` command, which
AWS CodeBuild also runs through your `buildspec.yml` file.

To test your new code during the release process, modify the existing tests or
add tests to the tests directory. AWS CodeBuild will run the tests during the
build stage of your project pipeline. You can find the test results
in the AWS CodeBuild console.

What Should I Do Before Running My Project in Production?
------------------

AWS recommends you review the security best practices recommended by the framework
author of your selected sample application before running it in production. You
should also regularly review and apply any available patches or associated security
advisories for dependencies used within your application.

Best Practices: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/best-practices.html?icmpid=docs_acs_rm_sec

What I Added
-----------

Deployment directory with sample CloudFormation JSON & README on how to use it.
Two services, items and admin. Items is an example of how to do CRUD operations on the database.
Swagger definition of the API.
Cognito user pools.
